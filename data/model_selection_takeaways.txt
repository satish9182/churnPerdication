📊 MODEL SELECTION SUMMARY:

1. OVERALL PERFORMANCE:
   • All models achieved >75% accuracy
   • Best performing: Logistic Regression (F1: 0.5789)
   • Worst performing: Decision Tree (F1: 0.5026)

2. CRITICAL INSIGHTS FOR CHURN PREDICTION:
   • RECALL is most important (catch actual churners)
   • High precision prevents false alarms
   • F1-Score balances both metrics

3. MODEL CHARACTERISTICS:
   • Tree-based models (RF, XGBoost): Better performance
   • SVM: Lower recall (misses more churners)
   • Logistic Regression: Good baseline, interpretable
   • Decision Tree: Risk of overfitting

4. RECOMMENDED MODEL: Logistic Regression
   ✓ Best F1-Score (0.5789)
   ✓ Good recall (0.5348) - catches 53.5% of churners
   ✓ Balanced precision (0.6309)
   ✓ Will be tuned in next step for optimal performance

5. NEXT STEPS:
   → Hyperparameter tuning for Logistic Regression
   → Cross-validation for robust evaluation
   → Final model training and deployment
